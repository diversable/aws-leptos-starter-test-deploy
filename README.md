# Leptos Starter Template for AWS Lambda

This is a template for the [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) web framework managed with [cargo-leptos](https://github.com/akesson/cargo-leptos) and integrated with [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) for deployment on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

## Creating your template repo

If you don't have `cargo-leptos` installed you can install it with

```bash
cargo install cargo-leptos
```

Then run

```bash
cargo leptos new --git leptos-rs/start-axum
```

to generate a new project template.

```bash
cd aws_leptos_starter_test_deploy
```

to go to your newly created project.
Feel free to explore the project structure, but the best place to start with your application code is in `src/app.rs`.
Additionally, Cargo.toml may need updating as new versions of the dependencies are released, especially if things are not working after a `cargo update`.

## Running your project

```bash
cargo leptos watch
```

The `--release` flag enables the [axum-aws-lambda](https://github.com/lazear/axum-aws-lambda) layer,
which only works within the AWS Lambda environment,
so it should be avoided locally.

## Installing Additional Tools

By default, `cargo-leptos` uses `nightly` Rust, `cargo-generate`, and `sass`. If you run into any trouble, you may need to install one or more of these tools.

1. `rustup toolchain install nightly --allow-downgrade` - make sure you have Rust nightly
2. `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` - add the ability to compile Rust to WebAssembly
3. `cargo install cargo-generate` - install `cargo-generate` binary (should be installed automatically in future)
4. `npm install -g sass` - install `dart-sass` (should be optional in future

## Compiling for Release

```bash
cargo leptos build --release
```

Will generate your server binary in target/server/release and your site package in target/site

## Testing Your Project

```bash
cargo leptos end-to-end
```

```bash
cargo leptos end-to-end --release
```

Cargo-leptos uses Playwright as the end-to-end test tool.
Tests are located in end2end/tests directory.

## Deploying Your Project

To build and deploy your project to AWS, you'll need [cargo-lambda](https://www.cargo-lambda.info/).
They provide [installation instructions](https://www.cargo-lambda.info/guide/installation.html) on their site.

Let's start by building the project with `cargo-leptos`:

```bash
cargo leptos build --release
```

We won't use the server binary that it builds, since
the Lambda function requires a particular architecture that
`cargo-lambda` will handle for us. If you'd rather not build the server twice,
you'll have to manage the WASM build and optimization yourself.

Next, let's build the production server binary:

```bash
LEPTOS_OUTPUT_NAME=aws_leptos_starter_test_deploy cargo lambda build --no-default-features --features=ssr --release
```

This should produce a binary at `target/lambda/aws_leptos_starter_test_deploy/bootstrap`.
`Cargo.toml` exposes all the required environment variables to `cargo-lambda`
so that the server can run in production.

Finally, we can deploy the project to AWS:

```bash
cargo lambda deploy --include target/site --enable-function-url
```

After a few seconds, `cargo-lambda` should print out the URL of your deployed function!

This template provides a GitHub action that handles all these steps automatically.
To use it, you'll need to provide your AWS credentials as [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).
You'll also need to provide the project name as a variable.

## Notes

### Credentials

You'll need AWS credentials with some permissions for IAM and Lambda operations.
`cargo-lambda` provides the [minimum requirements here](https://www.cargo-lambda.info/commands/deploy.html#user-profile).

Setting up permissions can be a bit onerous if this is your first time working with AWS.
For a quick and dirty setup, you can:

1. Create a new user in the IAM service (Access Management > Users)
2. Click "Attach policies directly" on the "Set permissions" page
3. Add the "AWSLambda_FullAccess" and "IAMFullAccess" policies, and complete the user creation
4. Create an access key for the user (don't worry about the warning)
5. Place the access key and secret key in `~/.aws/credentials` (or wherever the
   appropriate location is for your system):

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = ***************
aws_secret_access_key = **************
```

### State

Since AWS Lambda is a serverless platform, you'll need to be more careful about how
you manage long-lived state. Writing to disk or using an axum state extractor will
not work reliably across requests. Instead, you'll need a database or other
microservices that you can query from the Lambda function.

### Optimizations

Serving static files from a lambda function is not the best approach.
Ideally, you should upload your files to a CDN and configure
your project to serve them from that location.
AWS has an article on deploying [React with SSR](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-server-side-rendering-for-react-in-aws-lambda/).

It's also pretty easy to set up edge compute with Lambda@Edge,
which should improve latency for users around the world.
